                    Chemistry is the study of matter: its structure, composition, properties 
                    and the changes it undergoes. Chemistry is one of the three main branches 
                    of pure science, the other two being physics and biology. The knowledge of 
                    chemistry helps us to subject matter to chemical processes thereby producing 
                    materials for our every day today use. Such materials include: soaps, detergents, 
                    hair cream, perfumes, oil, margarine and plastics among others.
