                    The most widely accepted definition of economics
                    was given by Professor Lionel Robbins. He defined economics as follows: 
                    “Economics is a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship 
                    between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses”. His definition 
                    is widely accredited because it embraces the following terms:
                </p>
                <ol className="content-ol">
                    <li>
                        (i)	Economics is a Social Science because it deals with human 
                        behaviour and the activities of the people in the society. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (ii)	Ends: These are needs which are desired by the consumer 
                        to give satisfaction. Examples are cars, clothes, foodstuffs, 
                        handsets, books etc. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (iii)	Scarce means: “Means” are resources which are scarce relative 
                        to the demand for them. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (iv)	Alternative uses: The scarce resources can be put to so 
                        many uses. For example land can be used for farming or construction of 
                        houses, factories.

                <h2 className="content-h2">Scope of Economics</h2>
                <p className="content-para">
                    Economics covers the actions and activities of individual households 
                    and firms (microeconomics); and the actions and activities of the 
                    government (macroeconomics) in relation to production, distribution, 
                    consumption, money and exchange of goods and services.

                <h2 className="content-h2">Importance of studying Economics</h2>
                <p className="content-para">We study economics for the following reasons</p>
                <ol className="content-ol">
                    <li>
                        (i)	It enables the individuals, households, firms, and the government to 
                        know how limited resources can be used effectively and efficiently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (ii)	Reduction of resource wastage: Economics helps to reduce wastage 
                        in resource allocation. Economic decision-makers channel their resource 
                        to areas where they are mostly needed. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (iii)	Solution to basic economic problems: The study of Economics 
                        provides students with basic skills for analyzing economic problems.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        (iv)	Technique of reasoning and critical thinking: Economics teaches 
                        the techniques of reasoning and power of critical thinking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (v)	Provision of basic tools for analysis: Economics equips the economic 
                        agents with the tools of economic analysis to understand and solve current 
                        issues and economic problems confronting the society e.g. oil glut, 
                        oil spillage, oil theft, unemployment etc. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (vi)	Rational decision-making; economics enables individuals, and 
                        other economic agencies to be rational or reasonable in the application 
                        of scare resources to satisfy unlimited wants. A normal individual takes 
                        decisions in the most acceptable and beneficial ways.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        (vii)	Helps government economic policies and development: economics 
                        helps us to weigh the economic policies of the government, determine 
                        their advantages and disadvantages and offer the right suggestions on 
                        the way forward e.g. problem of unemployment, ‘white-elephant’ projects, 
                        inflation, budget etc. 
                    </li>
